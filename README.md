# golois_project

This project has been made for the Deep Learning course at Universit√© Paris Dauphine, through the Master 2 IASD degree. The project follows the golois implementation made by Tristan Cazenave. Through this project, we have explored several deep learning architectures to improve a computer GO program, such as MobileNet V2, MixNet, or ResNet architectures.
